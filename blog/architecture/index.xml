      <description>I have taken part in development of tens enterprise project during my career.

It is quite easy to understand the layered architecture principles and get a vision how to separate layers vertically. However, developers usually have issues when they need to make a decision concerning horizontal separation of concerns and how exactly business logic should be separated.</description>
