      <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing unit tests, especially for data converters, requires creating a lot of POJOs and populate them to see that fields&amp;rsquo; values are mapped correctly. In my previous experience, projects had simple POJOs and it was not a big deal to fill them with data manually, however, one of the last projects has complex model and creating test objects with all the relations became an issue. I started to finding for a solution that can create and populate objects for me and found a great tool called &lt;a href=&#34;https://devopsfolks.github.io/podam/&#34;&gt;PODAM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
